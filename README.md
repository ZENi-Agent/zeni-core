# ZENi

ZENi is a privacy-first behavioral data and execution layer for AI agents. It turns online and on-chain user signals into clean, structured, human-verified intelligence that agents can directly use for reasoning, retrieval, training, and real-time decision-making.
User-verified micro-tasks provide high-quality labels and ground truth, while the AI converts intent into provable workflows, rewards, and outcomes on-chain.

## Features

- AI-Driven Semantic Intent Engine: Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to decode unstructured social interactions into deterministic on-chain intents, ensuring a seamless transition from Web2 activity to Web3 transaction execution 
- AI-Verified Social Tasks: Uses AI to intelligently verify Web2 social engagements (e.g., X/Twitter likes, posts) before triggering rewards.  
- Automated Reward Settlement: Seamlessly converts social contributions into on-chain assets on opBNB without manual claiming.
- Gasless User Experience: Leveraging backend-managed wallets to handle gas fees, providing a truly "invisible" Web3 experience for non-crypto users. 
- Social-to-Web3 Bridge: A frictionless gateway that turns social influence into tangible on-chain reputation and rewards.
